# CSCI570SequenceAlignmentProj

An implementation of the Sequence alignement algorithm used in computational biology.

- Dynamic Programming implementation using M x N memory
- Divide and Conquer solution using twice the computational time but reducing the memory space required by a factor of at least a billion (in respect to actual DNA inputs)
